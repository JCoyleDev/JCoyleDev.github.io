    <h1>How To Create Your First GitHub Web Page</h1>
    <div id="preparationSection">
      <h2>Preparation:</h2>
        <p>Before you create your web page in GitHub, there are a few things that will need to be set up beforehand.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You will need to install a program where you can create an HTML file and write the code for your web page. While you can technically use Microsoft's Notepad for this, the best practice is to use an industry standard program such as Visual Studio Code. Download VSCode by clicking <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here</a>.</li>
            <li>
              Create a new root folder where you will store the files for your repository. You can set this up anywhere you want to.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose an image that you would like to use as your profile image and save it to the new root folder that you created in the last step.
            </li>
            <li>
              (Optional) Create a README file within your root folder that will tell others a bit about your web page. 
            </li>
          </ul>

    </div>
    <div id="createHTMLSection">
      <h2>Creating the HTML File:</h2>
        <p>Next you will want to create the HTML file which will provide the structure for your personal web page.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In your chosen code editor, create a new file called "index.html" sans quotation marks. 
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have some familiarity already with HTML, then go ahead and set up the document however you'd like. If you are completely new, I would recommend starting with a basic structure like this:
                <img src="images/basichtmlsetup.png" id="basicHTMLSetupScreenshot" title="Basic HTML Setup Screenshot" width="300" />
          </li>
          <li>
            In the body, you'll want to create a heading for your page using a header tag, such as h1 or h2. It can be as simple as "Your Name's Portfolio". 
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, you'll insert your profile image below your heading using the img tag. Your src property for this tag will depend on where inside the root folder, you saved the profile picture. For this example, we will just assume you saved everything in a single folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            After completing the last two steps, your document should look something like this:
              <img src="images/simpleportfoliohtmldoc.png" id="simplePortfolioHTMLDocScreenshot" title="Simple Portfolio HTML Doc Screenshot" width="400" />
          </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="createAccountSection">
      <h2>Creating an Account:</h2>
        <p>Now that you have your HTML document created and saved in your root folder, it's time to create your GitHub account.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start by navigating to the GitHub homepage at <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the "Sign Up" button in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter the email address you would like to link to your account, and choose a strong password.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pick a unique username that others can use to identify you on the site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Complete the remaining prompts to finish setting up your account. When you are done, you should be redirected to the home page. If you are not logged in, click login in the upper right-hand corner and type the login information you just created.
          </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="startNewRepositorySection">
      <h2>Starting a New Repository:</h2>
        <p>You're almost there! Now we are going to create the repository where you will upload the files for your web page.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the homepage, click the drop-down icon in the upper right-hand corner. On the drop-down menu, click "Your repositories".
          </li>
          <li>
            You won't have any repositories showing up yet, so next you'll click the green "New" button on the right-hand side of the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Title your repository whatever you'd like. You can even just retype your username. When you are done choosing the settings for the repository, click "Create repository" at the bottom of the form.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the following page, click the link that says "Upload files". You will be taken to a screen with a drag and drop uploader. Open a file explorer window on your desktop and navigate to the root folder you created that should now hold your index.html file and your profile photo. Drag and drop the contents of your root folder to the uploader in the browser. Click "Commit Changes".
          </li> 
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="checkFunctionalitySection">
      <h2>Checking for Functionality:</h2>
        <p>Lastly, you should make sure that your webpage is live. If you type repositoryname.github.io in your address bar, your custom webpage should be visible. Congratulations! You've just set up your first personal web page using GitHub!</p>
